## 🧠 The Motive

**Synapse Switch** is a brain-training game designed to test your cognitive flexibility. Your goal is to fight your brain's instincts by managing two conflicting tasks at once. It's not just about speed—it's about how fast your brain can "rewire" itself.

## 🎮 How to Play

### The Rules
1.  **You control two orbs:** A **Blue Orb** (left) and a **Red Orb** (right).
2.  **Follow the rules:** A rule is displayed for each orb (e.g., "Blue: HIT TRIANGLES").
3.  **Hit your targets:** You **MUST** hit every shape that matches your current rule.
4.  **Avoid the traps:** You **MUST** avoid every shape that does **NOT** match your rule.
5.  **No Mistakes:** Missing a correct shape or hitting an incorrect shape is **GAME OVER**.
6.  **The SWITCH:** Every few points, the difficulty increases, and the rules will **SWITCH!** Stay focused!
